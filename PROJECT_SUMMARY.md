# TV Remote Project Summary

## Project Overview
This is a web-based remote control for Android TV boxes that uses ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to send commands to the TV box. The interface is built as a web application and packaged as an Android app using Capacitor.

## Project Structure
- `www/` - Contains the web-based remote control interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- `android/` - Contains the Android project generated by Capacitor
- `server.js` - Node.js server that communicates with ADB to send commands to the TV
- `capacitor.config.json` - Capacitor configuration file

## Current Status
The project has been set up with Capacitor and the web assets have been synced to the Android project. However, building the APK directly on Android (Termux) is not possible due to limitations with the Java environment.

## Next Steps
1. **For Local Development**: Follow the instructions in BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md to build the APK on a desktop/laptop with proper Android development tools.

2. **For Automated Builds**: 
   - Push this code to a GitHub repository
   - Set up the GitHub Actions workflow (already created in .github/workflows/build-apk.yml)
   - Add signing secrets to your GitHub repository if you want to sign the APK
