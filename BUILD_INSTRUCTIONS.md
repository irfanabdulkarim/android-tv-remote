# TV Remote APK Build Instructions

This project uses Capacitor to build an Android APK. Due to limitations in Termux, the APK cannot be built directly on Android. Here are instructions for building on a proper development environment:

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js (v16 or higher)
2. Java JDK (v11 or higher)
3. Android Studio or Android SDK

## Building the APK

1. Clone or copy this project to your development machine

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Sync the web assets with the Android project:
   ```
   npx cap sync
   ```

4. Build the APK:
   ```
   npx cap build android
   ```

   Alternatively, you can open the project in Android Studio:
   ```
   npx cap open android
   ```
   Then build from Android Studio.

## Project Structure

- `www/` - Contains the web-based remote control interface
- `android/` - Contains the Android project generated by Capacitor
- `server.js` - Node.js server for ADB communication
- `capacitor.config.json` - Capacitor configuration

## For GitHub Actions (Optional)

You can also set up GitHub Actions to automatically build the APK when you push to your repository.
